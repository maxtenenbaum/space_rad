Hypercapnia Pipeline

Goals: Analyze spectral power across time and sessions

Pipeline:

Preprocess
1. Load and format data
2. Bandpass and isolate frequencies
3. Notch out line noise
4. Correct to ground

Visualize
1. Plot processed data
2. Plot LFP power (dB) for different frequency bands as a function of time (s) for all channels

Analyze
1. Run ANOVA to determine significant in difference between sessions
