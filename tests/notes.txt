Hypercapnia Pipeline

Goals: Analyze spectral power across time and sessions

Pipeline:

Preprocess
1. Load and format data
2. Bandpass and isolate frequencies
3. Notch out line noise
4. Correct to ground

Visualize
1. Plot processed data
2. Plot LFP power (dB) for different frequency bands as a function of time (s) for all channels

Analyze
1. Run ANOVA to determine significant in difference between sessions


///

DMN data

Goal: Find transient drop in DMN activity and subsequent increase in some region

Analyze 2 minute windows:
T+3-5 minutes
T+10-12 minutes

Preprocess
1. Load and format data
2. Bandpass and isolate frequencies
3. Notch out line noise
4. Correct to ground

Analyze
1. Plot power spectrum for each channel for the two windows
2. Highlight significant differences
3. Run ANOVA to determine significance
